Cluster 2 also has the most local authorities,

Cluster 1 has the second most local authorities, with 93, but the frequency of testing in these authorities is much lower in 2019 and 2020 and there was the lowest rate of increase between the two time periods at just 33%.

cluster 5 has the fewest local authorities, at 28, but the second highest total number of tests and the second largest increase in testing between 2019 and 2020, at 52%. A possible explanation is that cluster 5 contains some of the most populous local authorities in the country, including the cities of Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh. However, this cluster also includes large rural counties, such as Cornwall and Northumberland.
