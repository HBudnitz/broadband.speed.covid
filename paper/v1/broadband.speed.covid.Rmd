# Introduction

[our Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWjkmgzWGYKR9wFogKYw7l-8mZLoORt593x-Tu-f2-M/edit#heading=h.i5om1o8wpcd9)

**PARA1**: working from home is a challenge and maybe an opportunity [use arguments from @BUDNITZ2020102713]
It has been altered dramatically because of covid

**PARA2**: covind and working from home, cities, urban structure
Potentially useful readings for covid and cities:

- [productivity and WFM](https://www.coronavirusandtheeconomy.com/question/who-can-work-home-and-how-does-it-affect-their-productivity) 

It is important to become aware of working from home patterns because of:
- transport planning reasons (see para 1)
- WFM might increase coparing to pre-covid level

**PARA3**: How can we observe observe WFM? 
Directly through surveys (@felstead2020homeworking).
Add survey limitations (cost, reprentativeness, time lag between survey and data availability)
Data gap.
Passive data collection through internet speeds
Another option could be mobility data.
How is internet speed data a better source than mobility?

**PARA4**: Contention

**PARA5**: Data and methods

**PARA6**: Contribution:
