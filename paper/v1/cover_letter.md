Dear Editors,

Please find attached our manuscript entitled 'Working from home and digital
divides: resilience during the pandemic'.

Our paper, which is an original research article, offers a new perspective on
telecommuting from the viewpoint of the complex web of digital divides.
Using the UK as a case study, this paper studies how the quality and reliability
of internet services, as reflected in *experienced* internet upload speeds
during the spring 2020 lockdown, may reinforce or redress the spatial and social
dimensions of digital divisions. Fast, reliable internet connections are necessary
for the population to be able to work from home. Although not every place hosts
individuals in occupations which allow for telecommuting nor with the necessary
skills to effectively use the internet to telecommute, good internet connectivity
is also essential to local economic resilience in a period like the current pandemic.

We believe that our papers speaks directly to the aims and scope of
*Environment and Planning A*. It raises questions regarding urban and regional
restructuring and uneven development from the perspective of digital divides and
working from home during the current pandemic. These are issues of significant
economic and social concern especially considering the potential increase in
working from home after the pandemic. To address these questions, the paper
creatively blends concepts and ideas from urban and regional studies as well as
economies of technology, information. It builds a methodologically
innovative framework by employing time-series clustering methods and individual
broadband speed test data, which are rarely used in geographical studies.

We confirm that this manuscript is not published elsewhere, is not currently 
under consideration for publication elsewhere and will not be submitted to
another journal for consideration until a decision has been rendered by the editors.

Thank you for your consideration of the manuscript.
We look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,

Dr. Emmanouil Tranos and Dr. Hannah Budnitz
